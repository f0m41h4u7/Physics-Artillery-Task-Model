# Physics-Artillery-Task-Model
This is a model of throwing a body at an angle to the horizon, with different parameters.

1 task: 
Parameters: starting speed (v0) and direction.
Returns graphs(parabolas) on each case.

2 task:
Parameters: point (x,y).
Returns: v0 and angle.

3 task:
Parameters: v0 and angle. 
Returns: distance and 3d plot with parabolas at all directions.

4 task:
Parameters: v0, angle, r (resistanse of enviroment).
Returns: graphs(parabolas) on each case.
